<h1>Number Plate Detection using YOLOv8</h1>

This project implements a number plate detection system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system can identify and extract number plates from images with high accuracy and speed.

<h3>Features</h3>
Detects number plates in images and videos
Utilizes the latest YOLOv8 model for high performance
Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
PyTorch
ultralytics (for YOLOv8)

<h3>Installation</h3>

Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/rahulbiradar06/numberplate-detection.git

then add yoloV8 files in YOLO-Weights directory

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
